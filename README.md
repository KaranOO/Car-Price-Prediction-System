# Introduction
The Car Price Prediction System uses data from a variety of sources to train a machine learning model capable of predicting car prices. By analyzing features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more, this system can provide accurate and insightful predictions.

# Features
**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess raw data to ensure model accuracy.
**Model Training:** Train the model using state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques.
**Price Prediction:** Predict car prices based on user input and trained model.
**Visualization:** Visualize data trends and model performance.
**User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive user interface for easy data input and predictions.


#Installation
To run the Car Price Prediction System, you'll need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed on your system. Follow these steps:

#Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd car-price-prediction
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage
Prepare your data in the specified format.
Run the system using the command:
bash
Copy code
python car_price_prediction.py

#Data
The system uses a dataset containing various car features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The data is cleaned and preprocessed before being used for training and testing the model.

#Model
The model is trained using a regression algorithm and is fine-tuned for optimal performance. Advanced metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's accuracy.
